OVERVIEW

The Geospatial Area and Information Analyzer (GAIA) is a visualization
and analysis tool designed specifically to accommodate epidemiological
research. GAIA is a web-service that allows epidemiology application
developers the ability to create meaningful, rich visualizations of
data.

Currently, the GAIA web service (or server) resides at gaia.psc.edu
and can be accessed via our default client (gaia-client).  To access
the service, you must have the default GAIA client installed.


INSTALLATION

Download the GAIA software suite from <http://midas.psc.edu/>.

Extract the GAIA software using:

  mkdir gaia
  tar -xzf gaia-latest.tar.gz gaia

Build and install the components:

  cd gaia
  make
  make install

The gaia server includes an init.d script, so the daemon can be started automaticallly via the chkconfig and service commands.


SERVER CONFIGURATIONS

The server (gaiad) can be run with no options, with the default
behavior consisting of:

  GeoData database (-d): localhost (ipv4)
  GeoData user (-u): gaia

You can see a complete list of options by typing:

  gaiad -h

Alternatively, gaiad will also read a configuration file at startup via the "-c filename" option.  This file can contain a list of key, value pairs delimited by the "=" sign.  See samples/gaiad.conf for a complete list of configurable variables.
